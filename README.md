<h1>TV-Diff</h1>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

```
numba==0.53.1
numpy==1.20.3
scipy==1.6.2
tensorflow==1.14.0
torch>=1.7.0
```

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Configure the xx.conf file in the directory named conf. (xx is the name of the model you want to run)</li>
<li>Run main.py and choose the model you want to run.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ablated Variants</h2>
Due to the consistency of ablated variants, we did not include their hyperparameter in the xx.conf file. Whereas, if interested, you can alter them in the corresponding places in the code file.

<h2>Visualization Data</h2>
Due to the large files, we did not upload the data for visualization. If interested, please uncomment the code

```
with open('reconstruct', 'wb') as fp:
	pickle.dump(self.prediction, fp)
```
and run the models to get the reconstructed interaction matrices.

Then, rename the "reconstruct" file to "reconstruct_(model name)\_{dataset name}" for DM-based recommender models, and "emb_(model name)_(dataset name)" for classic recommender models. 

The visualization and heatmap will be generated by the "visual.py" and "heatmap.py", respectively.
